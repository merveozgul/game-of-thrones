# Predicting which characters will survive in the Game of Thrones?
There are approximately 2,000 characters in A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. This book series was the inspiration for 
the HBO series Game of Thrones. I predicted which characters in the series will live or die with classification models, 
and give data-driven recommendations on how to survive in Game of Thrones.
